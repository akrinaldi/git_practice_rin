The paper paradigm came up in my readings in a chapter by Eileen Gardiner and Ronald G. Musto on Electronic books.

We can conceptualize it as they do, as a conglomeration of paper document aesthetics that are then translated into digital software design.
Think of windowed documents from word processors that use the visual of block text on a white background and allows you to save your file in a folder.

The paper paradigm is a sort of digital proxy of print aesthetics, of digital documents trying to feel as close to their non-digital counterparts as possible.

Ebooks employ the paper paradigm in ways that include not just the look of the print on the screen, but also the tactility of turning the page to move through the text.
We know that we are not actually turning a page when we watch the little page flip animation on an ereader screen, but the action retains the texture of print all the same.
It feels familiar, draws the digital page into feeling like something you could pinch between your fingers.

But there is potential within electronic literature outside of mimicking the print book. It can hold potential for creating new forms, genres, and modes of writing altogether.

Here I turn to the words of Scott Rettburg, writing in a chapter titled “Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities” from A New Companion to Digital Humanities:
“A novelist working in hypertext is not only writing a fiction, but also experimenting with alternative models of textual navigation and user interaction. The author of a short story producing a narrative generator is not only writing a story but collaborating with a machine environment and coding a potential narrative system” (p. 129).
 
How is this work, spread as it is across blog posts, print pages, and the files within this repository, experimenting with alternative models of book formation?

I suppose that's still a question I'm weighing with that concept of paratext. Is it new, or is it just tangential?
