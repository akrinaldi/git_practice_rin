Finding the point of origin of a print book is a material process.

It would be easy to point to the publishing page, which gives us the location of the printer/publisher, the year of publication, and other metadata.
But provenance can also be determined through other aspects of materiality, such as the binding (Pearson, 2013) or the paper (Chamberlain, 2013).
The material of the binding can tell us more about when the book was bound, where it was bound, or even the class of the customer it was made for.
Paper also holds its own host of signposts for origin, with the types of fiber used and the consistency and uniformity of the fibers along with impressions from drying being traceable to certain regions and time periods.


But how do we determine the provenance of a digital document? We might search for its metadata, the date the URL was purchased, the date the content was made live.
But what version is considered the original?

What is the role of provenance in genre? Maybe it doesn't define genre, but it could provide disruption to genre stability when that provenance is incosistent, altered, or intentionally muddled.

In "Archiving DH Part 1: The Problem," a post by Ammon Shepherd, the longevity of the book is established as one of its major strengths:

"This is one reason why books are never going away; because books last a really, really long time. The book, as a vessel for the continuation of information, has a really long shelf life (pun intended). Anything digital does not" (Shepherd, 2019).
