"What if we understood AI as queer, a kind of mutant, in a state of becoming; a dynamic, relational, non-binary gender variant, how then might AI show up in and act on the world (with us humans) differently?"
  Mutant in the mirror: Queer becomings with AI, p. 4
  
"The mutant demonstrates the dynamic nature of becoming through relation. The mutant moves and mutates with me.
