"One needs an ability to imagine possibilities beyond what one already knows, but in order to learn to do this, one needs to imagine possibilities beyond or outside of what one already knows."

"I want to focus on the question of how we write—­how scholars in writing studies compose, report, organize, position, and narrate scholarship and research. Essentially, this essay takes up the question, what would it mean to write in queer(er) ways, to (regardless of what our research may be about) formally enact queer subversions of the norms that dictate the ways we deliver and write our research?"

"1. Commit rhetorical disobedience.
2. Write from a position of failure instead of writing from the position of what you think you know. Certainty is only queer when you are certain your knowledge is partial, failed, and fragmented.
...
4. Don’t stay “on topic.” Drift gleefully off. Get lost.
...
7. Imagine your writing outside the bounds of binary understandings: critical and creative, academic and personal, theoretical and practical. All of these all at once, or none of these all at once, which is a binary so nevermind."
